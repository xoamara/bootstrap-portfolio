                            they don't know if we're coming. Break off the attack! The shield is still up. I get no
                            reading. Are you sure? Pull up! All craft pull up! Take evasive action! Green Group, stick
                            close to holding sector MV-7. Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.

                            Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father? Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest. Yoda, I must
                            know. Your father he is. Told you, did he? Yes. Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
                            Unfortunate that I know the truth? No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that
                            incomplete was your training. Not ready for the burden were you. Well, I'm sorry. Remember,
                            a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side
                            are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.

                            You're free of the carbonite. Shhh. You have hibernation sickness. I can't see. Your
                            eyesight will return in time. Where am I? Jabba's palace. Who are you? Someone who loves
                            you. Leia! I gotta get you out of here. What's that? I know that laugh. Hey, Jabba. Look,
                            Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my
                            fault. It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're
                            Bantha fodder. Look... Take him away! Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a
                            fortune here. Don't be a fool! Bring her to me.
