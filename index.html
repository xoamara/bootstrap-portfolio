                            close to holding sector MV-7. Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.

                            know. Your father he is. Told you, did he? Yes. Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
                            Unfortunate that I know the truth? No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that

                            a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side
                            are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.

                            Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my
                            fault. It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but now you're
                            Bantha fodder. Look... Take him away! Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a
                            fortune here. Don't be a fool! Bring her to me.
